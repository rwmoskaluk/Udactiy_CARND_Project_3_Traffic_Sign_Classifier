## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  
---

### Data Set Summary & Exploration

#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the numpy library and built in python functions to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is **34,799 images**
* The size of the validation set is **4,410 images**
* The size of test set is **12,630 images**
* The shape of a traffic sign image is **(32px, 32px, 3 channels)**
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is **43**


#### 2. Visualization of Dataset

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the frequency of the labels for the training set of data.  In the training set we can see that there are varying frequencies from under 250 to well over 1750.  This can lead to a bias towards specific types of traffic signs (shape, color, or symbology). The next picture shows example of what one of each labeled training data images looks like.

### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because the consistency of the test image's color and lighting was skewing the training of the neural network and adding a fair amount of processing time.

As a last step, I normalized the image data because it allowed for the network to train faster along with removing any outlying pixel values for intensity in the image.

Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling with normalization.

#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x1 Grayscale and Normalized image  		| 
| Convolution 3x3     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 28x28x6 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x6 				    |
| Convolution 3x3	    | 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 10x10x16    |
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x16 				    |
| Flatten				| Output 400									|
| Dropout				| keep prob = 0.5								|
| Fully Connected	    | Output 120    								|
| L2 Regularization		| B = 0.001								        |
| RELU					|												|
| Dropout				| keep prob = 0.5								|
| Fully Connected	    | Output 84     								|
| L2 Regularization		| B = 0.001								        |
| RELU					|												|
| Dropout				| keep prob = 0.5								|
| Fully Connected	    | Output 43     								|
| L2 Regularization		| B = 0.001								        |


#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used the following hyperparameters:
* batch size: 128
* number of epochs: 100
* learning rate: 0.0005
* keep probability for dropout layers: 0.5
* L2 regularization for fully connected layers: B * l2_loss(fully connected layer weights), where B = 0.001
* Variables were initialized with mu = 0.0 and signma = 0.1
* Optimizer: Adam

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of **99%**
* validation set accuracy of **95.7%**
* test set accuracy of **94%**

If an iterative approach was chosen:
1) The first step was running the LeNet model from the lab.  This utilized an RGB image (32x32x3) for the input.  The accuracy for this training was somewhere in the **80%** range.  
2) The initial learning rate was dropped to a very low amount and then the epochs were increased.  To speed up training during this process the images were grayscaled and normalized.  This yield a high **80%** range for accuracy.
3) Seeing that as learning rate and epochs were adjusted and the model was overfitting dropout was added after each fully connected layer.  A probability of **50%** was chosen for what to keep.  This yielded a low **90%** range
4) Further reading suggested utilizing L2 regularization for reducing overfitting with the data set.  This was done after each fully connected layer for those layer weights.  The total sum of L2 loss was returned and then added to entropy score so that the optimizer could reduce the overall entropy and L2 loss when minimizing.
5) After some trial and error here the model was eventually able to reach a very close **93%** mark.  Further tuning of the epochs and learning rate proved to be the key to getting over **93%**.

### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web via Google maps in Berlin, Germany on the street Mohrenstra√üe 20.  These images were screenshots and then resized to 32x32 from Google street view.

https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mohrenstra%C3%9Fe+20,+10117+Berlin,+Germany/@52.5123685,13.388708,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a851d080705abb:0x860f462fe209dce5!8m2!3d52.51198!4d13.3908001

![alt text][image4] ![alt text][image5] ![alt text][image6] ![alt text][image7] ![alt text][image8]

The last image might be difficult to classify because it is a combination of the training set images and not directly in the image set that was trained with.

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Right of way at next intersection | Right of way at next intersection  									| 
| No Vehicles     			| No Vehicles 										|
| Yield					| Yield											|
| Traffic Signals	      		| Traffic Signals					 				|
| Speed Limit 30km/h			| Speed Limit 120km/h     							|


The model was able to correctly guess 4 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of **80%**. This does not compare well with the accuracy of the network.  If the last image that has never been seen before were to be dropped then this would be in line with the **94%** accuracy that the network yielded.  With this challenging image it does closely guess that it could be a speed limit sign of 30km/h

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

For the last image, the model is unsure as to what the sign is. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| 0.08         			| Speed Limit 30km/h   									| 
| 0.05    				| Speed Limit 50km/h 										|
| 0.10					| Speed Limit 80km/h											|
| 0.13	      			| Speed Limit 120km/h					 				|
| 0.08				    | Keep Right     							|

Otherwise for the other 3 signs the softmax probabilities were very close to 1, and the traffic signals sign was around **80%** with **20%** as General Caution.  The image below shows how certain the model was with each new German sign from Google street view.

### Improvements/Problems
Some improvements that could be done for this network are further adjusting the learning rate to increase performance along with extending the number of epochs.  Augmenting the dataset could also help improve the accuracy.

Further implementing the visualization of internally what the network is doing should be done.
